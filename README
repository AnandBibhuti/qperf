To build
    ./cleanup
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Changing version
    * Change VER_MAJ, VER_MIN and VER_INC as appropriate in src/qperf.c
    * Change version also in qperf.spec and configure.in

Notes
    * If the library ibverbs is not found, a version of qperf is built that
      does not support the RDMA tests.
    * Running "make clean" does not seem to clean up everything.  Run
      "./cleanup" instead.
